   	The goal of this exercise is to show how easy threads can communicate but
	also how easy it is to introduce concurrency bugs.

	Steps:

 1. We start from the threads version of this exercise. Copy either your or
	the given threads solution to the class below. Merge as necessary.

 2. Gather approximate results from the threads in a shared data structure.
	Make it possible for other concurrent threads to inspect the most up to date 
	value by calling the liveValue() method.

 3. Print out the live of Pi 100ms second after starting the threads, and
	before the join()s. It will be printed three times due to the warm-up.
